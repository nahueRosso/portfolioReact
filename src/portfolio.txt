Abaut me
I am a UX/UI designer from Poland. I specialize in creating clean and high converting user experiences for shops. In my daily work I participate in all creation processes, from understanding business needs, user creation, wireframing, design, prototyping and testing.


Inspired by art and movies.  
I love traveling and my dog Louis. I have a degree in art and a computer engineer.

Do you need analysis of your online store? I would be happy to prepare an audit based on Baymard.com , Hotjar.com and of course my knowledge and experience.

I can help you migrate your store to the Shopify platform or if you don't have any store, I can take care of creating a new one on Shopify.
I have experience in Amazon storefronts, product landing pages (A+ content). I have passed the UX exam and got certified by Baymard Institute.
